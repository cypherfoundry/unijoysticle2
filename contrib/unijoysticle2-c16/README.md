# C16/Plus4 board

This board is specifically designed for the TED series of Commodore computers (c16, c116 and Plus/4) and it is based on the work of [Levente HÃ¡rsfalvi](https://www.commodore.ca/manuals/funet/cbm/documents/projects/interfaces/plus4joy/plus4joy.html)

It uses the same firmware as the C64 version and works exactly the same, except for two particularities:

- Joystick \#1 and \#2 are swapped (default joystick in c16 games is usually \#1)
- The board can be self-powered or USB-powered, there is no barrel jack

## Important

Board **must** be 1mm thick or the mini DIN connectors won't fit!
