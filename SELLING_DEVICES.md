# Selling Unijoysticle devices

TL;DR: if you are selling Unijoysticle devices, don't call them "Unijoysticle" [*].

In the same spirit as the Arduino or Adafruit philosophy of Open Hardware, 
you are allowed to remix the Unijoysticle, and/or create your own boards, and/or sell
them if you want.

But you cannot sell them under the "Unijoysticle" name. Just choose your own name.
E.g: you can clone the Arduino or Adafruit boards, but you cannot sell them 
as if they were original Arduino or Adafruit boards.

It is precisely for this reason that, since the early beginnings of the project:

* I chose the [Solderpad Hardware License][license],
  which allows you to do almost whatever you want. But it doesn't transfer you
  the Trademark. The trademark is mine.

* Unijoysticle is a trademark, as I established [here][uni1_tm] and [here][uni2_tm].

[*]: The only exception is [KOPSEC64][kopsec64], whom I expressly authorized him to sell
     them using the Unijoysticle name.

## Rationale

I love retro-stores, and I believe the retro-stores play an important role within the retro-community.
But if you are selling Unijoysticle-like devices, just bear in mind that you cannot call them "Unijoysticle". 
You must choose another name. In fact, I would be happy to promote your store and include it in the
list of "3rd party vendors" if you needed so.

Apart for the fact that Unijoysticle is my trademark, I have decided to keep the name to myself for these
additional reasons:

- Avoid confusion.
  I'm selling Unijoysticle devices. If someone else were to sell them, it would certainly
  create confusion.
- Support.
  I provide support for the Unijoysticle devices. Therefore, it needs to be clear which boards are made by me (the Unijoysticle devices) and which are not. I can only vouch for the boards that I have built myself.
- Quality. The boards that I'm selling are high quality. And I want people to associate "Unijoysticle" with a
  high quality product. I can only vouch for the quality of the devices I've made myself.
- Family of products: I plan to offer Unijoysticle devices for other computers other than the C64. Thus, for this reason,
  I have chosen to reserve the right to use the Unijoysticle name for whichever product I deem suitable in the future.


## Examples of valid names created by 3rd party vendors

* [Unijoy2Amiga][unijoy] sold by Arananet.

This example shouldn't be interpreted as encouraging to use this or any other name already being used by the community.
